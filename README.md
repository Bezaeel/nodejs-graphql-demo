This project will now be upgraded using different technology at this time, employing best practices <br>
but sticking to the original mission (demonstrate knowledge).

Also, some new ideas would be sneaked in, one idea I'm so interested in at this time is version roll-out <br>
in software delivery. This project is going to mirror such scenario as close as possible, seeing that this <br>
upgrade is a new version of this project.

## checklist for migration
- [x] move project to nestjs
- [ ] multi-version support
- [ ] define dtos
- [ ] implement service layer
- [ ] unit test service layer
- [ ] implement resolvers
- [ ] integration test for resolvers
- [ ] containerization (docker)
- [ ] multi-instance (kubernetes)
- [ ] CI


## further improvement
This is for learning purpose and I am open to your ideas and suggestions twitter(@talabiope)
